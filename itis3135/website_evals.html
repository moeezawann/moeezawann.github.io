            <li>Contrast: Bold contrast between background and text, with live images and videos set against a clean backdrop.</li>

        <h2><a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/" class="anchor-website-eval">craigslist</a></h2>
        <p>Craigslist is one of the most known but maybe least used online buying/selling platforms. It allows people in specific places to post items
            for sale and those interested to purchase. It has since been outdated by platforms such as facebook marketplace, or offerup. However, still serves as a reminder 
            of the inital predecessors for online buying and selling.

        <ul class="website-eval-list">
            <li>Contrast: Applies contrast adequately, but lacks the visual impact needed to make key sections stand out.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Maintains consistency, though the basic color scheme and fonts give it an outdated look.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Layout is practical and straightforward, yet it could benefit from more dynamic elements.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Groups related content well, but dense packing of links and text may feel overwhelming.</li>
