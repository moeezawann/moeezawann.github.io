            <h2>Who Am I? </h2>
            <p>My name is Moeez, and I am a senior studying computer science with a concentration in IT at UNCC. If you haven't guessed by now, this is my webpage dedicated to my hobby working out!</p>
            <p>
                I've been working out on and off over the past two years, and I currently try to hit the gym as much as my schedule allows. 
                This semester has been particularly challenging in terms of finding time to work out, but I make a concious effort to fit in a workout whenever I can. 
                Through this page, I hope to give you some insight into my routines and share a bit about myself. I also hope to help you find a workout or routine that makes you feel comfortable and motivated.
            </p>

        <section id="what" class="rounded-box">
            <h2>What Is Working Out?</h2>
            <p>Working out can mean different things to different people. 
            Referring back to my "Who am I?" page, I mentioned how I want whoever is viewing this page to be able to find a workout routine that suits them.
            </p>
            <p>My preferred method of working out is going to the gym and lifting weights. However, this does not mean that it is the only way of working out.
              To me, working out is about staying fit, healthy, and comfortable in my own body. 
              Some days I don‚Äôt go to the gym; I might go for a long walk, a hike, or a swim if the weather permits. Similarly, working out can be the same for you it doesn‚Äôt have to involve weight lifting. 
              It can be anything that gets you physically active and with which you are comfortable.
            </p>

            <h2>When Should You Workout?</h2>
            <p>
                Working out or staying fit should not have to be a chore. For me, it is a way of bettering myself physically and mentally, all while improving my focus. 
                Therefore, I try to work out when I have good energy levels. I avoid doing late-night workouts because, on the several occasions I have, the workout has not been optimal the same applies if I‚Äôm tired.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, sometimes I find myself really wanting to go to the gym but also feeling tired. 
                To combat this, I try to take a thirty-minute power nap to get rid of the tiredness and then go to the gym. 
                Sometimes I fail the power nap trick and end up falling asleep I am human after all, haha. 
                Similarly, you should fit your workout into your schedule whenever it's convenient for you. 
                Also, take into account your responsibilities; missing a day or two is not the end of the world. We have to consider our personal situations.

            <h2>Where Should You Workout?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to where I work out, Planet Fitness is my go-to. They should sponsor me for this plug, but it is my preferred gym because of its price and hours.</p>
            <p>
                Although there are mutliple locations where I live I prefer to go to the one on S New Hope Rd. as it is close to my house and because I know where everything is. I have a bit of sentimental attachment to it as well since it 
                was the first gym I started working out at. Alongside this, I have made friends at this gym and see them sometimes throughout the week. 
                This is great because we get to see each other's progress, work out together, and sometimes we face injuries or just nagging pains together.
                Hence, having someone to talk to about these things or get someone's input on different workout techniques always helps!

        <section id="why" class="rounded-box">
            <h2>Why should you Workout?</h2>
            <p>Well, you don't have to work out if you don't want to. This is your life, I just so happen to be living in it.</p>
            <p>However, I will continue working out and hope you are able to find something that suits you as well. 
            Some of the benefits I have noticed from working out are that I have a healthier relationship with food. 
            I like to cook my own food, I watch what I am eating (except for Sundays, I get downnn), and I love the way my body is starting to look.
            Alongside this, getting stronger in the gym always feels amazing whenever I up the weight on excercises or when people tell me they see a difference in my physique. 
            There's always room for improvement in anything we do, whether it's studies, everyday life, relationships, etc. 
            I am just trying to become an overall better version of myself and hope some of what I am saying is motivating you to do the same!

        <section id="how" class="rounded-box">
            <h2>What Are Some Ways to Workout?</h2>
            <p>There are plenty of different ways to work out. Just take some of the alternatives I do when I am unable to get in the gym, for example.</p>
            <p>However, for you, this could mean rock climbing, paintballing, skating, cycling, running, hunting, yoga, or pickleball. The possibilities are endless; it does not have to be working out in a traditional sense. 
                Find something you are comfortable with, start small, and then progress as you and your body see fit. I took this same approach when I started working out. Some people get into the gym and try to do everything at once‚Äîthis is how you end up super sore and unable to go the next day. 
                Take it in small steps, and in due time, you will see the changes you are destined to see! I will give you my current workout schedule below if you are interested in going to the gym. You do not have to follow everything I do,
                find what suits you from my workout schedule and go from there. Cheers!
