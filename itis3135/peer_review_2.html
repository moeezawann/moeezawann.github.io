            <li>General Submission Requirements:
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>The page links directly to the review or includes a primary page with links: Yes</li>
                    <li>No spaces or uppercase letters in file/folder names (scripts, images, etc.): Yes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Design:
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and font sizing for readability: Yes, the site uses colors that are easy on the eyes. However a football or something like that in the header to fit the asthetic as text just seems basic.</li>
                    <li>Page uses consistent site colors and fonts via a standard `.css` file: Yes</li>
                    <li>CRAP principles are followed: Yes at the time of this review the content is not all there yet. However, he has filled out some section my only issue may be a different 
                        type of font that catches the eyes more. Regardless CRAP principles are being followed throughout the webpages.

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li> Additional Feedback: 
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>Stop: Using basic colors as I know your creativity. I've seen some of your other work and know you have some better color schemes up your sleeve.</li>
                    <li>Start: Better Spacing of nav elements in your header, maybe changing the divider to a football could be cool! </li>
                    <li>Continue: Your work as you defintley have an intresting client project definitley want to see more pictures.</li>
