			<h2>Contributions</h2>
			<div class="features">
				<ul id="feature-list">
					<li>Feature 1 — Map page, with google map integration that allows a user to see a list of recommended
                        meetup locations. User can then select a location from the list and see where it is relatively
                        located on google maps. All recommended meetup locations are presented on the map for users.
                    </li>
					<li>Feature 2 — Performed enhancements on th create lsitig page allowing for users to submit
                        their major category as well as sub category. Also added a googl map integration that allows
                        for users to enter the city in which the item is located. This helps with safety and privacy for users instead
                        of using their exact location.
                    </li>
                    <li>Feature 3 — Created the initial connection to our Firebase database, as well as creating a collection for our users
                        as well as a collection for our listing items. This allows us to pull our listing items and display them 
                        onto the home page, and get utilized in different ways.
                    </li>

			<h2>Project Journey</h2>
			<div>
				<p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p>
				<p id="learned">It takes a team not a person, this project was a good example for 
                    how teamwork is needed to get a working solution. It required everyone to be hands on 
                    and continusouly be practive on where improvemnts and enhancements are needed. 
                    Without the entire team working all hands on deck the completion of this appplication 
                    would not have been possible. 
                     </strong></p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
				<p id="challenges">
                    Time constraints is one of the big ones, knowing everyone can only dedicate a 
                    certain amount of time per week. So working wihtin these constraints was important,
                    secondly for me connecting our application to our back end was also a but difficult but 
                    once the connection was made things setelled down. 
                </p>

				<p><strong>Skills gained:</strong></p>
				<p id="skills">
                    I got to gain experince in both back end as well as front end development. I 
                    got the chance to expirement with technolgies I had not worked with before, as well as honing 
                    my own technical skills. Alongside of this building connections with my fellow classmates
                    teaching and leanirng from one another were also important skills gained and taught!
