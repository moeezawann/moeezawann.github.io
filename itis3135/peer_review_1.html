            <li>General Submission Requirements:
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>The page links directly to the review or includes a primary page with links: Yes</li>
                    <li>No spaces or uppercase letters in file/folder names (scripts, images, etc.): Yes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Design:
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>Sufficient contrast and font sizing for readability: Yes, the site uses colors that are easy on the eyes, the logo fit's the asthetic of the 
                        website and the font is well selected.</li>
                    <li>Page uses consistent site colors and fonts via a standard `.css` file: Yes</li>
                    <li>CRAP principles are followed: Yes at the time of this review the content is not all there yet. But i'm sure it 
                        will be soon. Nonethless, with the items currently visible on the page spacing, contrast, alignment and proximity.
                        All of these concepts are incorporated to ensure users are able to view and naviagte the site with ease.

                Main Content:
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>Main starts with the name of the page in an `h2` (not the site/brand name): No not at the moment it seems to be in
                        a paragraph element.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <li> Additional Feedback: 
                <ul class="nested-rev-list">
                    <li>Stop: Using so much whitespace ie you definitley need more content. But I am sure it will come along as you go. Your logo goes in well to you header/nav.</li>
                    <li>Start: Working on your project whenever you can!</li>
                    <li>Continue: Using your styling as it is very easy to follow for people and simple to understand.</li>
                </ul>
