        Contract
        I, <em> <a href="introduction.html">Moeez Awan</a></em> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my <em>Fall 2024, ITIS-3135 course with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</em> I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly.

    <p>
    I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed: <em>Moeez Awan, 09/10/2024.</em>
